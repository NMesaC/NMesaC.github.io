I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering senior with a focus on Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, and I expect to graduate with a B.S. in 2025. I am also a M.S. candidate for Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus in AI/ML Systems for 2026.

My interests currently lie in Multimodal Machine Learning and Agentic AI Systems. I am specificically interested in learning more about the fundamental technologies underpinning these systems and how we can improve agents to allow for more widespread adoption of these systems.

I enjoy connecting with others to discuss research ideas, work and projects! Feel free to reach out at nmesacuc [at] andrew.cmu.edu.
